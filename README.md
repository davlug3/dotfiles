# Dotfiles repo

This is my current dotfiles repo. Currently most of these are to setup my vim configuration.
I am trying to use git as my dotfile manager.

## Prerequisites
- export this environment variable `export DOTFILES_URL=https://github.com/davlug3/dotfiles`
- export this environment variable `export TERM=xterm-256color` (not really a prerequisite, but i like it)
- git
- curl

## Optionals
- vim
- tmux

How to use: 


For now, use JS Delivr CDN:
On a new system, pipe curl output to bash
```curl https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/davlug3/dotfiles/.dotfiles/install_dotfiles.sh | bash```


I haven't tested this yet on many systems. I am still experimenting on most of these. 
sakin lang muna to. 


## Future plans:
- try using a makefile
- just wing it
